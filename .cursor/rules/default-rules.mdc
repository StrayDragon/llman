This project develops and maintains a Cli app writen by Rust , you need to obey user request and write expert code without any unnessary comment (DO NOT VERBOSE OUTPUT CODE WITH ONE-STEP-ONE COMMENT)

NOTE:
- Prefer use tools like `context7` and `firecrawl` to fetch spec version pkgs (crates) usages and if you don't know just stop and make a question to user, don't write non exist code
- Use `justfile` to do project scope actions replace wite `makefile`, if not exist, please create one and add minimum cmds
- Do not change deps unless user request to do this, if you need change deps, you need stop to ask user
- If you need edit coding, prefer batch update text for decreasing too many tool calls
